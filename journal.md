Having little bits of reflection while looking at Suzanne Treister's work on fictional video games, and Vermis, about how this "pretending" works. One thing is that Pippin's "...doing paperwork" is quite playful and a bit more gamelike than some of the others. but also the tone of paperwork is quite serious and not "silly", so maybe it is the setting - at amaze they had these amazing stamps and stationery to play with. Where "making love" and "doing work" are much more game-y and silly in presentation and interactions. "doing work" especially.
Basically, there is a line where it becomes just a game of its own rather than a performance or a feeling of pretend. 
"...playing chess", and "...on your phone" feel much more performative, and part of that to me is the presentation. quite direct and serious instruction. For "board game" I wonder if that is important too - should this be _boring_ for the players. I don't want them to accidentally have fun, I just want it to look like they are having fun.

Also had an idea that tickled me which is to run a blind public playtest (maybe even at UK games expo), adding a meta "its as if you are designing a game".

Now on the train back from British DiGRA at Birmingham City University. Another interesting few days and actually really fun thinking about "britishness" with others. For me it resonated because talking about silliness, irreverence and sort of cheeky design (as opposed to being too earnest) being common in games, and games media in the UK from the 80's to today, connects with the "It is as if" games, which are sort of funny performance art pieces that make you smile.

The conference had the evening event at a board game cafe, which turned out to be a fun idea. Thinking about this project and watching people play was interesting. Funny to see some people break out Race for the Galaxy and Clank! Not short ones to explain and play. We left a copy of Meal Deal behind that might create a fun moment for someone, and a weird moment for staff, at some point.

Watching people play I've started a document with a list of potential instructions that reflect what I observed.

A few initial thoughts - I don't want to make it too mechanical. I had an idea to have a card that allowed you to interrupt another player and end their turn but this feels too much like a game. There shouldn't be any meaningful mechanical interaction.

Feel like it might be a good idea to weight the weirder ones, or include more generic movements. Check how Pippin deals with prompt landscape?

A few really inspiring days at A MAZE 25 in Berlin. I am literally in my hotel rooms between sessions and just writing some start to this process.
A highlight has been meeting and learning more from Pippin about his design process, and how it materialises insights about design in a compelling way. Pippin's approach uses github and commit messages as a way to document the process, but also as a point of thinking from within.
In the tour of his "It's as if you are..." games people would ask him questions about his process, and it was instructive to see how when he did not know the answer, he could open the design journal and just find out what he was thinking at the time. This felt very natural but also kind of liberating, he does not need to remember every detail.
This was less than an hour ago as I write this.

I want to give this a go myself so have started this repo to force myself into it without thinking too hard about it.

My first idea is immediately to play with Pippin's format and make a modest homage in the form of my own "almost as if.." as a way to give it a go and to think about the process from within the process.

My longer term idea is that this might change my own design practice - spread over scraps of papers, notes, emails and obsidian files - and also potentially help students who are interested in research through design as a method to be used in designing games. This is on my mind right now because Oliver and I have been talking a while on this, and will present something next week at BDigra.

I am struggling in this moment not to edit and add links etc, and overly curate these journal entries and accidentally make a blog.

The second idea off the top of my head (after "its like you were at a book signing" we played today) is to do a version with board games. just because of the really abstract nature of board games as representations of other systems (e.g. war or factories, the two kinds of game) makes them inscrutable from the outside.

initial ideas are: just using an ordnance survey map and shit loads of tokens and dice, then have the game played with a "deck" of instructions.
Move a cube 8cm towards your opponent. Roll 2 dice and sigh. open the nearest book and start leafing through pages like you are looking for something.

that's it at the moment. There is definitely going to be long gaps between commits and journal entries, because i've so much marking at the moment, however it was important to me to start.
