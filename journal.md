Thinking about the board, and how to handle this problem of legibility. 

I want spectators to notice that they are playing a game (so, tracks? visible spaces and structure?) but for that on closer inspection that there be no meaning there.

The immediate thought is some kind of optical illusion - spaces that turn into negative spaces, or things that don't line up. 

But also it should frustrate anyone looking for meaning - it should be functionally impossible to people to "move 3 spaces" or whatever. 

The big risk here is the board becomes "artwork" and takes attention. This is ok, in a "sharing on social media and maybe getting some press" but it means a) effort, and b) compromising a bit on my "usual" half-baked and thrown together aesthetic.

I've been looking at Escher, and things like the Penrose triangle, but these are very much too "on the nose". Maybe something paradeoilia (sp?) like the old "dreaming ai" nonsense from a few years ago.

side track here: i wonder how shit LLM AI would be at designing a board game - it is kind of doing a similar thing I am - making something that statistically appears to be a game, but lacks the internal logic either intentionally (in my case) or unintentionally (because AI does not understand systems of rules that are balanced in a game).

Also a note for me - it doesnt have to be big - A3 feels about right. Maybe 4 A5 boards that connect together?

Also a bit worried about cards being already too legible but this is like the only anchor to reality - I need to hold players hands a little bit after all. This links to speculative/critical design stuff really - there's always that anchor to reality that is subverted once you engage.

Related is this art project that created board games that look like games but miss pieces: https://boingboing.net/2014/12/02/a-gallery-of-impossible-board.html



This is kind of the opposite of what I want - these imply logic that does not exist. Still very cool and definitely relevant though. 

Also inspired by "let's gtfo the earth" which has nice sketchy diagrams. plus the "zine" unfinished/glitched, ambiguous aesthetics. 

Looking at BGG pages of games in play. https://boardgamegeek.com/images/boardgame/all?sort=recent&gallery=game&tag=Play&page=4

I think the reality is boardgames look quite diverse, but that's a reality and not playing to our assumptions, and in this game I want assumptions.
"Mousquetaires du Roy" is a hood example of just an incredibly generic board.

Also started thinking about the rules but half a mind to just not give any rules at all and let them look for it.
Maybe just a double sheet of paper that says "stare at this section for 10 seconds. then stare at the section opposite...

Again thinking about presentation, and the board and pieces specifically. My initial idea was that it could just be an ordnance survey map or something, with random components.
I think this can work but my reasoning is that I do not want it to be too "gamey". What I mean is that there is certain legibility from someone who plays a lot of board games. we understand hexes, cubes etc and they have implications around representation of space, and tracking statistics respectively. 
Sideways to this is thinking about City of Six moons and a conversation with Doruk - the game is an alien artefact but it still uses the grammar of board games. Cards can be shuffled, pieces go on spaces, a rulebook exists, etc etc. I don't know if the game subverts this at all - I should spoil it for myself - but it kind of bugs me that it is a human perspective of what an alien game would look like. I think there are very real, understandable, and probably intentional practical reasons for this - shipping a bag of slime and calling it a board game would be just to abstract, so I get why six moons looks the way it does. But it feels a bit like "robots are human shaped" as far as speculative fiction goes. Reminds me a little of the dog internet (obviously!) in that our imagination of the "other" stops at anthropocentric/selfish assumptions. Again not a critique of Amabel's work, which is uniformly brilliant.

So for my game, it is for the spectator so the pieces should not carry or imply meaning for the players. They should give the appearance of meaning from outside (i.e. non game player) but carry no intrinsic meaning within. I might ask that question to players in a playtest. "if you saw this collection of material as a game, can you guess at the rules?"

At the back of my mind is the clip from parks and rec(i think?) about "cones of dunshire". but thats a fictional real game, but also relies on some awareness of game tropes - medieval building, wooden pieces... although cones are not a common piece really. but it does look game-shaped from the outside.
...

just brushed my teeth and had two further thoughts:

V-Effekt (where have i been reading about that recently? amabels book i think?) - alienation of the players in "its as if" games more generally. How can I make my "players" feel alienated from the activity and the game and reflect on their position as players.

Numberwang - "it's as if you were playing a game show" basically

Was thinking about the final presentation of the game. I like that it could just be game-esque things rather than specific components. Thinking about how game pieces are just chunks of abstracted wood and card. A magazine serves as the rulebook.
And for the game box - the box itself is part of the "act" of the game. People look at the box art, and back, there is a ritual in opening it (and box farts). But I don't really want to make a box, that feels too direct. Maybe a sleeve for a standard box size? Or just a 3d flat picture of a box? Maybe something about the IKEA KALLAX shelve sizing that has affected game boxes?

Playing board games last night and overhearing explanations was fun. "Put three blueberries on the blueberry track, advance the hazelnut and then sum the value of two dice", said as one might explain how to assemble flatpack furniture. It feels too silly to be real, in a weird way though. 
The silliness is something I'm resisting. It is the sort of thing I'd go overboard in trying to make it funny. For example having people pick words, or make each other say things. 
Similarly trying to not make it too gamey as mentioned before. I think all the cards should be different, even though my game design senses are saying to duplicate cards, or mirror effects. 
So how many cards? 52?

Having little bits of reflection while looking at Suzanne Treister's work on fictional video games, and Vermis, about how this "pretending" works. One thing is that Pippin's "...doing paperwork" is quite playful and a bit more gamelike than some of the others. but also the tone of paperwork is quite serious and not "silly", so maybe it is the setting - at amaze they had these amazing stamps and stationery to play with. Where "making love" and "doing work" are much more game-y and silly in presentation and interactions. "doing work" especially.
Basically, there is a line where it becomes just a game of its own rather than a performance or a feeling of pretend. 
"...playing chess", and "...on your phone" feel much more performative, and part of that to me is the presentation. quite direct and serious instruction. For "board game" I wonder if that is important too - should this be _boring_ for the players. I don't want them to accidentally have fun, I just want it to look like they are having fun.

Also had an idea that tickled me which is to run a blind public playtest (maybe even at UK games expo), adding a meta "its as if you are designing a game".

Now on the train back from British DiGRA at Birmingham City University. Another interesting few days and actually really fun thinking about "britishness" with others. For me it resonated because talking about silliness, irreverence and sort of cheeky design (as opposed to being too earnest) being common in games, and games media in the UK from the 80's to today, connects with the "It is as if" games, which are sort of funny performance art pieces that make you smile.

The conference had the evening event at a board game cafe, which turned out to be a fun idea. Thinking about this project and watching people play was interesting. Funny to see some people break out Race for the Galaxy and Clank! Not short ones to explain and play. We left a copy of Meal Deal behind that might create a fun moment for someone, and a weird moment for staff, at some point.

Watching people play I've started a document with a list of potential instructions that reflect what I observed.

A few initial thoughts - I don't want to make it too mechanical. I had an idea to have a card that allowed you to interrupt another player and end their turn but this feels too much like a game. There shouldn't be any meaningful mechanical interaction.

Feel like it might be a good idea to weight the weirder ones, or include more generic movements. Check how Pippin deals with prompt landscape?

A few really inspiring days at A MAZE 25 in Berlin. I am literally in my hotel rooms between sessions and just writing some start to this process.
A highlight has been meeting and learning more from Pippin about his design process, and how it materialises insights about design in a compelling way. Pippin's approach uses github and commit messages as a way to document the process, but also as a point of thinking from within.
In the tour of his "It's as if you are..." games people would ask him questions about his process, and it was instructive to see how when he did not know the answer, he could open the design journal and just find out what he was thinking at the time. This felt very natural but also kind of liberating, he does not need to remember every detail.
This was less than an hour ago as I write this.

I want to give this a go myself so have started this repo to force myself into it without thinking too hard about it.

My first idea is immediately to play with Pippin's format and make a modest homage in the form of my own "almost as if.." as a way to give it a go and to think about the process from within the process.

My longer term idea is that this might change my own design practice - spread over scraps of papers, notes, emails and obsidian files - and also potentially help students who are interested in research through design as a method to be used in designing games. This is on my mind right now because Oliver and I have been talking a while on this, and will present something next week at BDigra.

I am struggling in this moment not to edit and add links etc, and overly curate these journal entries and accidentally make a blog.

The second idea off the top of my head (after "its like you were at a book signing" we played today) is to do a version with board games. just because of the really abstract nature of board games as representations of other systems (e.g. war or factories, the two kinds of game) makes them inscrutable from the outside.

initial ideas are: just using an ordnance survey map and shit loads of tokens and dice, then have the game played with a "deck" of instructions.
Move a cube 8cm towards your opponent. Roll 2 dice and sigh. open the nearest book and start leafing through pages like you are looking for something.

that's it at the moment. There is definitely going to be long gaps between commits and journal entries, because i've so much marking at the moment, however it was important to me to start.
