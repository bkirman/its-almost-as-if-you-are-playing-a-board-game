# 16/5/25 
A few really inspiring days at A MAZE 25 in Berlin. I am literally in my hotel rooms between sessions and just writing some start to this process.
A highlight has been meeting and learning more from Pippin about his design process, and how it materialises insights about design in a compelling way. Pippin's approach uses github and commit messages as a way to document the process, but also as a point of thinking from within.
In the tour of his "It's as if you are..." games people would ask him questions about his process, and it was instructive to see how when he did not know the answer, he could open the design journal and just find out what he was thinking at the time. This felt very natural but also kind of liberating, he does not need to remember every detail.
This was less than an hour ago as I write this.

I want to give this a go myself so have started this repo to force myself into it without thinking too hard about it.

My first idea is immediately to play with Pippin's format and make a modest homage in the form of my own "almost as if.." as a way to give it a go and to think about the process from within the process.

My longer term idea is that this might change my own design practice - spread over scraps of papers, notes, emails and obsidian files - and also potentially help students who are interested in research through design as a method to be used in designing games. This is on my mind right now because Oliver and I have been talking a while on this, and will present something next week at BDigra.

I am struggling in this moment not to edit and add links etc, and overly curate these journal entries and accidentally make a blog.

The second idea off the top of my head (after "its like you were at a book signing" we played today) is to do a version with board games. just because of the really abstract nature of board games as representations of other systems (e.g. war or factories, the two kinds of game) makes them inscrutable from the outside.

initial ideas are: just using an ordnance survey map and shit loads of tokens and dice, then have the game played with a "deck" of instructions.
Move a cube 8cm towards your opponent. Roll 2 dice and sigh. open the nearest book and start leafing through pages like you are looking for something.

that's it at the moment. There is definitely going to be long gaps between commits and journal entries, because i've so much marking at the moment, however it was important to me to start.
