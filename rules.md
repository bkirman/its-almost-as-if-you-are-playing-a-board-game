It is almost as if you are playing a board game.

Skim through the pages of this booklet and furrow your brow.

Look quizical for 4 seconds and then say "Ahh I get it" (I know you don't)

Think of a board game that you have played but the others maybe haven't. Take your time, they think you are reading the rules. Say "Oh I see, it is like [that game]"

Say "Err... it says here to lay out the pieces on the board and in front of each player"

Point at a piece and say "I think that goes near me"

Look carefully at the board for a moment and then back at these rules.

How many cards does each player get? Decide and declare it confidently. They don't know that you don't know.

The start player is the one who goes first

Stare at this sentence for 5 seconds and say "We'll figure it out as we go"
