It is almost as if you are playing a board game.

Skim through the pages of this booklet and furrow your brow.

Say "Err... it says here to lay out the pieces on the board and in front of each player"

Point at a piece and say "I think that goes near me"

Look carefully at the board for a moment and then back at these rules.

Say "I think we get 3 cards each... maybe"

Say "The start player is the one who goes first"

Stare at this sentence for 5 seconds and say "We'll figure it out as we go"
